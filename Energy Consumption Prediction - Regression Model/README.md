**Documentation of Energy Consumption Prediction Workflow**

### Objective
The goal of this project was to build and optimize machine learning models to predict energy consumption based on various building and environmental features. The dataset provided included information on building type, square footage, number of occupants, appliances used, average temperature, and day of the week.

### Steps Undertaken

#### 1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**
- **Data Overview**:
  - Training Dataset: 1,000 entries, 7 columns.
  - Testing Dataset: 100 entries, 7 columns.
  - Columns included both categorical (`Building Type`, `Day of Week`) and numerical variables (`Square Footage`, `Number of Occupants`, etc.).
- **Findings**:
  - No missing values were found in the dataset.
  - Outliers were detected in numerical features (e.g., `Square Footage`, `Number of Occupants`), but these were retained for model training.

#### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **Categorical Encoding**:
  - Applied one-hot encoding to the categorical variables (`Building Type` and `Day of Week`), avoiding the dummy variable trap by dropping one category.
- **Feature Scaling**:
  - Standardized numerical variables using `StandardScaler` to ensure all features were on the same scale.

#### 3. **Model Building**
- Three machine learning models were selected for initial training:
  1. **Linear Regression**
  2. **Random Forest Regressor**
  3. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- The training dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

#### 4. **Performance Evaluation**
- The models were evaluated on the testing dataset using:
  - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.
  - **R² Score**: Indicates the proportion of variance in the target variable explained by the model.
- Initial Results:
  - **Linear Regression**: Excellent performance but might overfit.
  - **Random Forest Regressor**: High accuracy but slightly higher MSE.
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Best balance of accuracy and error.

#### 5. **Model Optimization**
- Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV for the following models:
  - **Random Forest Regressor**:
    - Tuned parameters: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`.
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**:
    - Tuned parameters: `n_estimators`, `learning_rate`, `max_depth`.
- Optimal hyperparameters were selected based on cross-validation R² scores.

### Final Results
- **Optimized Models**:
  - **Random Forest Regressor**: Showed significant improvement in R² score and reduced error.
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor**: Achieved the best overall performance with fine-tuned hyperparameters.
- The optimized models were ready for deployment or further testing on unseen data.

### Key Learnings
- Feature scaling and encoding are crucial for ensuring model accuracy and stability, particularly with linear models.
- Hyperparameter tuning significantly enhances model performance, especially for ensemble methods like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

### Next Steps
- Test the optimized models on the provided testing dataset.
- Deploy the best-performing model to a production environment for real-time energy consumption prediction.
- Explore additional advanced models or deep learning approaches for potential further improvement.
